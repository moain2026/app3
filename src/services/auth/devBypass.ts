/**
 * Dev Bypass Mode — العباسي تحصيل
 *
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  PURPOSE
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * When the legacy server is unreachable (Tailscale VPN down, server moved,
 * fresh QA device that does not yet have its `secureId` registered, etc.)
 * the operator can still drive the app end-to-end by entering the FIXED
 * credentials below. The login flow short-circuits BEFORE any network call
 * is made, mints a fake `AuthUser` with full permissions, and surfaces a
 * persistent yellow "DEV MODE" banner on every authenticated screen so the
 * operator cannot mistake mock data for production data.
 *
 * Wave 4 ships this so the team can test:
 *   • the Readings module (list, detail, save, dirty markers)
 *   • the navigation + RTL + theme
 *   • the printer + sync UX (offline-first)
 * without waiting for the auth migration story (PR #21 + PR #22) to resolve
 * the `secureId` mismatch between the new device and the legacy server.
 *
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  SECURITY POSTURE
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * • The bypass credentials are PUBLIC constants — they are documented in
 *   the LoginScreen UI itself. There is NO confidentiality story here.
 * • The bypass user is local-only: tokens are sentinel strings that the
 *   axios interceptor will refuse to attach to outbound requests
 *   (any /electric/* call would fail authentication server-side).
 * • Mock data lives entirely in WatermelonDB on the device; `sync_queue`
 *   enqueue is SKIPPED when `isDevBypass=true` so the device never tries
 *   to push fake rows up to the production server.
 * • A future hardened build can simply delete this file + the two call
 *   sites in `authStore.ts` to compile the bypass out.
 *
 * See also:
 *   • src/stores/authStore.ts — early branch on login() that calls
 *     isDevBypassCredentials() before contacting /electric/Login.
 *   • src/services/mock/seedMockData.ts — auto-populates 25 readings
 *     on first launch into bypass mode.

 * server will simply reject with 401. We do NOT special-case the token
 * value in the network layer; the bypass user is meant to operate offline.
